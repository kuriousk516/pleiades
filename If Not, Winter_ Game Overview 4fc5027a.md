# Overview

## 📐 Project scope

* **Budget:**
* **Timeline:**

## 🗣️ Elevator Pitch

16-year-old Esther travels the northern, isolated trails of 1898 Canada northward to the gold mining town of Leore to find her missing mother, encountering strange mysteries as she uses her wits to stay alive and return home.

## 👨🏿‍🤝‍👨🏾 Audience

While the ambition for this game is to be a widely available product through game host services such as Steam and the PlayStation Store, for the purposes of this Major Research Project, the scope of the audience will be limited to first and second-year university students. It would be my hope that a university class (or two) could act as a test group for the first prototype of the game to get feedback about the game mechanics, story, and the historical complexities and nuance that is meant to tie the latter two together. After building on that feedback, then the development would move forward and make adjustments accordingly. 

By choosing university students (approximately 19 or 20 years old), they are in an environment that would focus specifically on the interactions between the story, the game choices and mechanics (and what they say about the narrative itself), and historical representations. They are better equipped to read into the nuance of the game and suggest meaningful changes and offer valuable insight into how the game functions and how it can improve. 

## 💵 Monetization

*Briefly explain how/if you plan to monetize the game.*

Players will pay a one-time fee of $5 to play the game. No further monetization will be included. 

# Story

*A one-paragraph synopsis of the story. If the story is too long, save the details for a separate document.*

Esther, a 16-year-old girl from a poor, immigrant family. She leaves her ailing father and three young girls in Toronto to traverse the dangerous and isolated trails of northern Ontario in search of her mother in Leore, a once-bustling goldrush town, and the player must unravel the mysteries surrounding Leore and Esther’s family.

  * This has some REALLY neat concept art that perfectly encapsulates the kind of style the game would be in, despite the art being for a film.
